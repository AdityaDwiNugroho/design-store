# ADMIN PANEL SECURITY
# ====================

# Admin Panel Password
# Set a strong password for accessing /admin/newsletter
# Use a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-very-secure-admin-password-here

# Allowed Admin IP Addresses
# Comma-separated list of IP addresses that can access the admin panel
# 
# FOR DEVELOPMENT (localhost):
# ALLOWED_ADMIN_IPS=127.0.0.1,::1,localhost
#
# FOR PRODUCTION - Add your public IP address:
# Find your public IP using one of these methods:
#
# Method 1: Online IP checker websites
# - Visit: https://whatismyipaddress.com/
# - Visit: https://ipinfo.io/
# - Visit: https://checkip.amazonaws.com/
#
# Method 2: Command line (your current public IP)
# Windows: curl ifconfig.me
# Linux/Mac: curl ifconfig.me
# OR: curl ipinfo.io/ip
#
# Method 3: Server IP (if hosting on VPS/server)
# Windows: ipconfig
# Linux: ifconfig or ip addr show
# 
# Example for production:
# ALLOWED_ADMIN_IPS=127.0.0.1,::1,localhost,203.0.113.12,198.51.100.42
ALLOWED_ADMIN_IPS=127.0.0.1,::1,localhost

# IP ADDRESS SETUP GUIDE
# ====================
#
# DEVELOPMENT (Local):
# - Use: 127.0.0.1,::1,localhost
# - No changes needed for local development
#
# PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT:
# 
# Step 1: Find Your Public IP
# ------------------------
# Visit https://whatismyipaddress.com/ to see: "Your Public IPv4 is: XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX"
# OR run in terminal: curl ifconfig.me
#
# Step 2: Add Your IP to ALLOWED_ADMIN_IPS
# ----------------------------------------
# ALLOWED_ADMIN_IPS=127.0.0.1,::1,localhost,YOUR_PUBLIC_IP_HERE
#
# Step 3: If Using Cloud Hosting (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
# -------------------------------------------------------
# You may need to add the hosting provider's IP ranges or use a different approach
# For Vercel: Consider using Vercel's authentication or environment-based restrictions
#
# Step 4: Multiple IP Addresses
# -----------------------------
# Home IP: 203.0.113.12
# Office IP: 198.51.100.42  
# VPN IP: 192.0.2.146
# Result: ALLOWED_ADMIN_IPS=127.0.0.1,::1,localhost,203.0.113.12,198.51.100.42,192.0.2.146
#
# SECURITY NOTES:
# - Keep this list minimal (only IPs you trust)
# - Your public IP may change (check with ISP about static IP)
# - Consider using a VPN for consistent IP if you travel
# - Monitor your admin access logs regularly
