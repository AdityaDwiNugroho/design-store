# Stripe Payment Setup Guide

## âœ… Status: Ready for Real Payments

Your store is now configured to accept real payments through Stripe. Follow these steps to go live:

## 1. Create Stripe Account
1. Go to https://stripe.com and create an account
2. Complete the verification process (may take a few days)
3. Activate your account for live payments

## 2. Get Your API Keys
1. In Stripe Dashboard, go to Developers > API keys
2. Copy your **Publishable key** and **Secret key**
3. Keep these keys secure - never share them publicly

## 3. Update Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```env
# Stripe Keys (Replace with your actual keys)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_publishable_key_here
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_secret_key_here

# Your domain (for success/cancel URLs)
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

## 4. Test Your Payment Flow

**Important**: You can test and use payments WITHOUT setting up webhooks first.

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Add items to your cart
3. Click "Proceed to Checkout"
4. Use Stripe's test card numbers:
   - **Success**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - **Declined**: `4000 0000 0000 0002`
   - **Requires 3D Secure**: `4000 0025 0000 3155`
   - Use any future expiry date, any 3-digit CVC, and any ZIP code

### Quick Start (No Webhooks Needed)
For basic functionality, you only need:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_key_here
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 5. Go Live (When Ready)
1. Complete Stripe account verification
2. Switch to live API keys in your environment variables
3. Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to your production domain

## Advanced Configuration

### Webhook Setup (Optional - For Production)
Webhooks ensure you're notified when payments succeed, even if the customer closes their browser.

**Note**: Webhooks are optional for basic functionality. Your checkout will work without them.

#### To Set Up Webhooks:
1. **First, deploy your app** to get the live URL:
   - **Vercel**: `https://your-app-name.vercel.app`
   - **Netlify**: `https://your-app-name.netlify.app`  
   - **Custom domain**: `https://yourdomain.com`

2. In your Stripe Dashboard, go to "Developers" â†’ "Webhooks"
3. Click "Add endpoint" button
4. Add your webhook URL based on where you deployed:
   - **Vercel**: `https://your-app-name.vercel.app/api/webhooks/stripe`
   - **Netlify**: `https://your-app-name.netlify.app/api/webhooks/stripe`
   - **Custom**: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
5. Select those events:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
6. Click "Add endpoint"
7. **After creating the endpoint**, click on it to view details
8. You'll see the "Signing secret" - this starts with `whsec_`
9. Copy this secret and add it to your deployment environment variables:

```bash
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here
```

#### If You Don't See Webhooks:
- Make sure you're in the correct Stripe account
- Check if you're in Test mode vs Live mode
- The webhook secret only appears AFTER you create the webhook endpoint
